**CoffeeCoin2.0 (OC)**

CoffeeCoin2.0 (CFC)

Coffeecoin2.0 utilizes pure "Proof of Stake" to secure the network. Initial release consists of roughly 100 million coins, completely premined and swapped with the older, corrupt version of CoffeeCoin. POS interest will be earned at a rate of 10% in the first year. The interest rate will decrease at a rate of 5% per year until a floor of 1% is reached. For example, the first year will be 10%, the second year will be 9.5%, the third year will be 9.025%, fourth 8.57%, etc. It will take approximately 45 years to reach the 1% floor.

Coins will be eligible for staking after 24 hours, and will continue to accumulate "staking weight" for 90 days. With PoS, the coin is more resilient to 51% attack.
